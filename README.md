# coralnu ðŸª¸
## coref resolution with spaCy `neuralcoref` + AllenNLP
> ðŸ’¡ this repository stores the code for a flask inference wrapper for **coralnu** â€” a coreference resolution implementation that combines neuralcoref and AllenNLP â€” alongside scripts to deploy the code for inference using WSGI/Gunicorn.

### about coralnu
**coralnu** [cor-al-noo] performs **CO**reference **R**esolution with **Al**lennlp and **N**e**u**ralcoref using ensemble methods to achieve a fuzzy intersection. to combine the clusters identified by both spaCy `neuralcoref` and AllenNLP's `coref-spanbert-large`, coralnu uses a method of intersection that favours AllenNLP (owing to high GAP performance) as the ground truth, and includes all spans that partially overlap in `neuralcoref` and `AllenNLP` clusters, but prioritises the shorter span. Find out more in NeuroSYS's [blog post](https://neurosys.com/blog/effective-coreference-resolution-model) or browse the code.

### quickstart: make requests to the hosted endpoint
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/endpoint%20status-online-brightgreen">

**N.B.** There is an issue with the [coralnu.whisp.dev](https://coralnu.whisp.dev) endpoint, as the `nginx` proxy is refusing requests based on HTTP headers â€” to avoid this issue, please use the script below. Progress on this issue is being [tracked here](https://github.com/whispAI/coralnu/issues/2).

```python
import requests

def get_corefs(text):
    url = "https://coralnu.whisp.dev/coref"
    myobj = {'text': text}
    x = requests.post(url, json = myobj)
    return x.json()

text = "Born and raised in London, Daniel Day-Lewis excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre, before being accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, which he attended for three years."

get_corefs(text)
```
**Returns**
```json
{
  "clusters" : [
    [
      [
        6,
        9
      ],
      [
        31,
        31
      ]
    ]
  ],
  "method" : "fuzzyIntersection",
  "resolved" : "Born and raised in London, Daniel Day-Lewis excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre, before being accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, which Daniel Day-Lewis attended for 3 years"
}
```

### installation guide
**N.B.** this guide has been prepared and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 running on an AWS [g4dn.xlarge] instance, equipped with an NVIDIA T4 GPU.

**Initial Configuration**
* Perform one-time initial updates with `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`
* Download the latest [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installer, for example `curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh`.
  * Start the installation with `bash Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh` and follow the prompts
* Set up your `conda` environment with `conda create --name coralnu python=3.7`

**Install Dependencies**
* Activate your new conda environment with `conda activate coralnu`, you should now begin to install the dependencies.
* Install build tools as below:
  * `conda install -c conda-forge gxx`
  * `conda install -c conda-forge cxx-compiler`
  * `sudo apt-get install python3-dev`
* **Install AllenNLP:** first `â€Œpip install allennlp` then `pip install --pre allennlp-models`
* At this point, you may wish to check that CUDA is configured correctly with a simple script as below...
```py
import torch
x = torch.randn(10, 10, device='cuda')
print(x)
```
  * You should receive a tensor as an output.
* **Install Neuralcoref:** first, run `pip install spacy==2.1` to install the version of spaCy compatible with both coreference frameworks. Ensure to install a suitable spaCy model with `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`.
  * Finally, install `neuralcoref` with `pip install neuralcoref --no-binary neuralcoref`

**Prepare `flask` server**
* Install Flask with `pip install flask`
... will finish @lucafrost
