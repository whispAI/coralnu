# coralnu ðŸª¸ ~ coref resolution w `neuralcoref` + `AllenNLP`
> ðŸ’¡ this repository stores the code for a flask inference wrapper for **coralnu** â€” a coreference resolution implementation that combines neuralcoref and AllenNLP â€” alongside scripts to deploy the code for inference using WSGI/Gunicorn.

### about coralnu
**coralnu** [cor-al-noo] performs **CO**reference **R**esolution with **Al**lennlp and **N**e**u**ralcoref using ensemble methods to achieve a fuzzy intersection. to combine the clusters identified by both spaCy `neuralcoref` and AllenNLP's `coref-spanbert-large`, coralnu uses a method of intersection that favours AllenNLP (owing to high GAP performance) as the ground truth, and includes all spans that partially overlap in `neuralcoref` and `AllenNLP` clusters, but prioritises the shorter span. Find out more in NeuroSYS's [blog post](https://neurosys.com/blog/effective-coreference-resolution-model) or browse the code.

### quickstart: make requests to the hosted endpoint
**endpoint is currently offline**
```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://nlp.whisp.dev/coref"

payload = json.dumps({
  "text": [
    "Born and raised in London, Daniel Day-Lewis excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre, before being accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, which he attended for three years"
  ]
})
headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
```
